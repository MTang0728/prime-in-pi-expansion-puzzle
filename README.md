# Prime in π Expansion Puzzle
# Euler Project

This repository contains the solution to one of Google's recruiment puzzle, which asks candidates to find the first 10-digit prime in the arbitrary epxansion of π.

When solving these problems, I attemped to use the divide and conquer approach and broke the question into 3 sub-components. The solution of each problem consists of 3 helper function. In addition, I have a Medium blog post that describe the approach I have taken.
